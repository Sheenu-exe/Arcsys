# Chat Interface Project

Hi, I'm **Sachin Parihar**, and this project is part of my assignment at Arcsys. The goal was to build a responsive chat interface.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sheenu-exe/arcsys.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd arcsys
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** The chat interface is fully responsive. On mobile, the sidebar transforms into a sliding drawer, making it easy to navigate and manage different chats even on small screens.
- **Framer Motion Animations:** Messages animate smoothly when they appear in the chat, enhancing the user experience.
- **Dynamic Sidebar:** You can switch between different users to simulate different chat conversations, and it auto-scrolls to the latest message.
- **Mobile-Friendly Sidebar:** The sidebar collapses into a drawer on mobile screens, providing a clean and intuitive UI.
  
### My Approach

While working on this project, my main goal was to balance functionality and user experience. The mobile-first approach ensures that the chat interface works seamlessly on all devices, from small screens to large desktops.

Using **Tailwind CSS**, I was able to quickly prototype and style the UI. The integration of **Framer Motion** gave the chat a smooth and lively feel, making the experience more interactive.

I hope this project demonstrates my understanding of front-end development and my ability to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
